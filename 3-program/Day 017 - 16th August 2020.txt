Day 017 - 16th August 2020
================================================

1. Write a program in C++ that converts from miles to kilometers. 
Your program should have a reasonable prompt for the user to enter
a number of miles.
Hint : 1 miles = 1.609 kilometers.

-----------------------------------

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values.
Store these values in int variables named val1 and val2. Write your program to 
determine the smallest, largest, sum, difference, product and the ratio of 
these values and repost them to the user.

--------------------------------------

3. Modify the program above to ask the user to enter floating-point values
and store them in double variables. Compare the outputs of the two programs for 
some inputs of your choice.
