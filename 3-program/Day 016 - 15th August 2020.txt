Test! = for me too! 
---------
Writing a letter using user input.
---------

1.  This drill is to write a program that produces a simple form letter based 
on user input. Begin by typing the code by asking the user to enter his or 
her first name and writing "Hello, first_name" where first_name is the name 
entered by the user. Then modify your code as follows:
change the prompt to "Enter the name of the person you want to write this letter."
and change the output to "Dear first_name,". Don't forget the comma.

2. Add an introductory line or two, like "How are you? I am fine. I miss you."
Be sure to indent the first line. Add a gew more lines of your choice -- after all
it's your letter.

3. Now prompt the user for the name of another friend, and store it in 
friend_name. Add a line to your letter: "Have you seen friend_name lately?"

4. Declare a char variable called friend_sex and initialize its value to 0.
Promt the user to enter an m if the friend is male and an f if the friend is female.
Assign the value entered to the variable friend_sex. Then use if-else statement to write 
the following:
If the friend is male, write "If you see friend_name please ask him to call me."
If the friend is female, write "If you see friend_name please ask her to call me."

5. Prompt the user to enter the age of the recipient and assign it to an int
variable age. Have your program write "I hear you just had a birthday and you are age years old."
If age is 0 or less or 110 or more, call - error("You're kidding!").

6. Add this to your letter:

If your friend is under 12, write "Next year you will be age+1".
If your friend is 17, write "Next year you will be able to vote."
If your friend is over 70, write "I hope you are enjoying retirement."

check your program to make sure it responds appropriately to each kind of value.

7. Add "Yours Sincerely," followed by two blank lines for a signature, followed by your name.
